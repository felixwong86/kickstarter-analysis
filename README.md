# Kickstarer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis on Kickstarter data is to help Louise uncover trends such as ideal month of the year to launch her campaign and the probability of backers to make the pledge towards her campaign goal of 4000 GBP.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the Kickstarter data we have worked with, a majority of the successfull campaigns were launched in the month of May compared to the rest of the year. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Findings in the Kickstarter data were that campaigns with goals of less than $1000 or up to $4999 enjoyed up to 70% of reaching their goals whereas campaigns with higher values had a lower chance of finding enough backers. In Louise's case, she is expecting a low 50% success based on her campaign value of 4000 GBP (~$5200 USD)


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - We can conclude that May is the best month of the year to launch a campaign while the months of June and July also showed promise of 80% or higher success rate.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Campaigns of $4000 or less have the highest success rate in reaching their goals

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - This identified trends in the dataset are only filtered for the theater subcategory and findings may not be applicable in other categories.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - We could use bar graphs or pie charts to demonstrate our findings
